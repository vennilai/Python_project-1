We have to write some conditions to run this projects.
1.if user_choice and computer_choice both are same then its gives the output is Draw
2.if computer_choice is grater than user_choice Then it gives the output as user will loose the game
3.if user_choice is grater than computer_choice then it gives the output as user will going to win
4.if computer_choice is 0 and user_choice is 2 then it will give the output as user will going to lose the game 
5.if user_choice is 0 and computer_choice is 2 then it will give the output is user will win the game
6.if user_choice is grater than equals to 3 or user choice is lessthen 0 the it will give the output as you enter invalid number and you lose the game 
these are the conditions to perform this project
